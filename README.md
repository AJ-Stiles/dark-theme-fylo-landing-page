## My process
I started out by creating the html markups first before styling. I ensured i started styling my website from top to bottom.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learnt how to use flexbox and css grid for the very first time without aid of any framework.


```html
<div class="social">
      <i class="fab fa-facebook"></i>
      <i class="fab fa-twitter"></i>
      <i class="fab fa-instagram"></i>
    </div>
```
```css
:root{
    --intro-email-bg: hsl(217, 28%, 15%);
    --main-bg: hsl(218, 28%, 13%);
    --footer-bg: hsl(216, 53%, 9%);
    --testimonials-bg: hsl(219, 30%, 18%);
    --cyan: hsl(176, 68%, 64%);
    --blue: hsl(198, 60%, 50%);
    --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
}
```

### Continued development

- I'd like to continue focusing on media queries and also the flexbox and grid properties.
